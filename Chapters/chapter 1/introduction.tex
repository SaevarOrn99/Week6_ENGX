People who have limited function in the lower extremity can greatly benefit from walking short distances to prevent muscle loss, strengthening the bones and maintain healthy blood flow among other things \cite{services_walking_2023}.

The product being developed is a semi autonomous following wheelchair, that can benefit ambulatory wheelchair users, which are people who use a wheelchair while having some walking ability \cite{tyler_ambulatory_2020}. 
The product can also benefit rehabilitation centers, that would use the product to help their customers, during physio therapy sessions. 
Now there is an employee whose job it is to push the wheelchair behind the client during sessions, so the product could allow the employees to allocate their time to something more important. 
Even though the users can be of all ages, this project focuses on users who use a standard wheelchair size, for adults.
