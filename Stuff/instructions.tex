\section{Signatures}
\fxerror{Signature instructions need updating}
Please make note of the signature pages at the beginning of the document.
These need the examiner's and advisors' signatures to be complete.
There is also a page for copyright release that needs to be signed so the library can keep a copy.
You must include the signed pages when you upload your document electronically to Skemma.

\section{Printing}
If you decide to print, make sure you are doing it on archival acid-free paper.
Otherwise, your document will yellow and fall apart in the library over time.
Traditionally, the student prints out and binds a copy for each advisor and examiner.
This may also be required if the research was funded or in certain circumstances.
If you are using a printing house to take care of the binding, they may be able to take the completed PDFs (cover and inside text) and print them for you.
Check with the printing house if they want it as A4 (to be trimmed) or as B5 (which they will take care of resizing).

\section{Submission}
When your document is finished and approved by your advisor, it needs to be uploaded to Skemman~\url{https://skemman.is}.
An important thing to remember is that the uploaded document will follow you for the rest of your career:
employers are likely to find it and skim it.
Make sure the document is something you would be proud to have associated with you.

The general submission sequence is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Defense complete, minor corrections complete after 3 days of work.
\item Save the completed thesis text as \path{main.pdf}
%\item Get signature pages signed by supervisor(s) and examiner.
%\item Sign the library release page.
%\item Scan the pages in, put them into the document in the appropriate places.
\item Open the official cover files in \path{cover}, fill in the appropriate fields, and save as a \path{cover.pdf}
  \item Use a PDF binding tool such as PDFsam \url{https://pdfsam.org} to putthe cover before the first page and save as \path{thesis.pdf} 
\item Upload the finished \path{thesis.pdf} to Skemman.
\item An autogenerated email is sent from Skemman.
  This email should be forwarded to your admin such at \TItvdadmin{}.
\item Grade for the thesis is published.
\item Graduation!
\item Sometime after graduation, the published thesis is released by RU on Skemman for others to read and enjoy.
\end{enumerate}

\section{LaTeX Template Instructions}
Some information is at the top of \path{main.tex} file, this file is for a general overview and common problems.
%More information on working with LaTeX at
%\url{http://afs.rnd.ru.is/project/htgaru/trunk/how-to-get-around-projects.pdf}

\subsection{Getting started:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find a safe place to work on your thesis document.
  The author recommends Git on Overleaf, but anywhere data is backed up is a appropriate.
  If you wish to have a repository to be setup for your thesis on \url{openproject.cs.ru.is}, email csit AT ru.is.  
  If you are working with sensitive information, you should avoid bitbucket, google drive, dropbox, and any other free cloud service.
  If you think this is unnecessary, just consider how much time you will lose if your computer crashes.
   Due to Murphy's law, this is likely to happen just before your thesis is due\footnote{This has happened many times.}.

 \item Get a LaTeX installation.  We recommend TeXlive \url{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}
   For this template on windows, MiKTeX will also work, but will run very slowly the first time you render the template.
   You will need to enable the ``miktex'' option in the template to substitute packages.
   It is very very important that you run the ``MikTeX Update Wizard'' before you start.
   Otherwise you may get errors when you try to build the document.

   Under linux this is the ``texlive'' package.
   Under Mac/OSX this is the ``MacTeX'' distribution.

   Alternatively, if nothing you are doing is particularly private or proprietary, you can do development online using Overleaf.
   In this case, you won't need to setup the rest of the tools mentioned below except perhaps the Reference Manager mentioned in step~\ref{list:refmanager}.
   

   \begin{enumerate}
   \item RedHat: sudo yum -y install
     texlive-collection-fontsrecommended
     texlive-biblatex-{apa,apa-doc,ieee,ieee-doc}
     texlive-{xargs,lipsum,lastpage,luatex,pseudocode,url,examplep,listings,xspace,pgf,tikz,amsfonts,amsmath,amssymb,siunitx,svn-multi,subfig,fixme,textpos,biblatex,makeglos,nomencl,xwatermark,ltxkeys,framed,boondox,printlen}
     Getting biber installed on older RedHat systems is a bit tricky
     for unclear reasons.  The metapackage you need is at
     https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/cbm/Biber/ 
   \item Debian/Ubuntu:
     sudo apt-get -y install texlive-full pgf latex-xcolor
     If you don't want to install everything, this list of packages is known
     to work: sudo apt-get -y install texlive texlive-luatex texlive-latex-extra
     texlive-science texlive-generic-extra texlive-lang-european
     texlive-lang-german latex-xcolor texlive-pictures pgf
     texlive-bibtex-extra texlive-publishers chktex evince
     fonts-lmodern lmodern biber
   \end{enumerate}
 \item Get a LaTeX Integrated Development Environment (recommended, but not required)
   \url{http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/} or
   \url{http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/}
   Some editors may include LaTeX support.
   If you want to learn a very powerful (but old-fashioned) editor \url{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/}
      Install the auctex package by: M-x list-packages, click on AUCTeX

    \item Get a references manager (recommended, but not required)\label{list:refmanager}
   \url{http://jabref.sourceforge.net/}  (You may have to install a Java JRE first.)
   The reference library is in \path{references.bib} by default.
   It is just a text file that can be edited, but be careful with the formatting.
   A common mistake is to forget ``,'' at the end of each piece of an entry/line.

   If you are going to make glossaries or acronym lists, you will need
   a perl interpreter.  Only windows usually needs this installed:
   \url{http://www.activestate.com/activeperl}

 \item Get supporting programs for some tools.
   For glossaries under windows, you will need to install Perl
   \url{http://strawberryperl.com/}
   (it is already installed on the other platforms.)
   
 \item Try building the \path{main.tex} file.  If you get errors, there
   is something wrong with your LaTeX installation.  Fix those first.

   
 \item Rename the \path{main.tex} file with your information (optional).
   DEGREE-NAME-YEAR is the recommended scheme 
   e.g. \path{msc-foley-2015.tex}.
   This is referred to as the "Main" file.
 \item Set your UI to use \path{lualatex} as the processor.
   If you are typing commands in manually, this is by typing in \path{lualatex main.tex}
   
 \item Open and read the options at the top of the previous file and set
   it up for your document.
   You will need to fill in the title and author at least.

 \item Start editing all of the \path{.tex} files with your content.

 \item Compile the document by running lualatex on the Main file, run the bibliography tool, then view the result.

 \item When you print, make sure that the scale is 100\%.
   If you allow it to resize when printing, the margins won't be right.
   If the  margins aren't right, then the RU logo will not look right on the
   cover.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Important Details}

\begin{itemize}
\item Make absolutely sure that your \path{references.bib} is in UTF-8.  If it is another format (CP1251,etc) you may get weird problems with any accented characters.
  {\em Students have run into encoding issues in the past and it has taken a surprisingly long time to debug.}

\item Make sure the rest of the files, particularly the \path{.tex} file are in UTF8 or are at least in the same encoding.
  If the files are in different encoding, you will discover errors with accented characters when you try to include them together.
  Watch out for line endings. Linux, Windows, and OSX all use different line endings in text files.

\item You may wish biber/biblatex instead of bibtex.
(The template may already do this.)
Otherwise Icelandic characters may not work properly in your \path{references.bib} file.
TexMaker and TeXStudio require a configuration change to do this.
%Refer to the ``...Projects'' guide above.

\item Be consistent about UPPER and lower case in naming files.
  Windows doesn't care (but some programs in Windows do).
  OSX sometimes cares.
  Linux always cares.
\item When using this template with SVN, you will want to tell it to ignore the extensions listed in Appendix~\ref{appendix:latex-gen}
\end{itemize}

\section{SE Master's Thesis Special Instructions}
These rules are adapted from \url{https://www.ru.is/media/tvd/skjol/Vidbotarreglur_um_meistaraverkefni_2017_as_accepted_15_08_2017.pdf}
\subsection{Rules: Adopted by the School Council August 15th 2017}
The following rules are an addition to \textsc{Rules for MSc Progrmmes at Reykjavík University's School of Science and Engineering}
as adopted by the council of the School of Science and Engineering August 15th 2017.

The Council of the School of Science and Engineering first adopted these rules on 19th March 2010 and they have since undergone minor revisions.

In 2022, members from the School of Engineering, School of Computer Science, and Communications met to simplify the requirements and harmonize them between the two departments.

In order to graduate with an MSc degree from the School of Science and Engineering (SSE) all students must complete a project that results in a formal thesis and a public defence of the thesis.
The thesis can be submitted either in English or Icelandic and should sufficiently present a body of work commensurate with the number of credits of the particular MSc project.

\subsection{Thesis Layout and Form}
The layout and form of the thesis shall in general be according to good practice for a thesis of this type. The student shall consult his/her supervisor on an appropriate structure for the thesis, appendices to the thesis and the reference system, taking into account established practice within the specific field of research. Each department within the School of Science and Engineering may set rules that further specify the form and layout of the thesis, including a recommended template.

In general, the thesis is expected to contain the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Front and back cover (standard)
\item Title page (standard format)
\item Abstract (in English or Icelandic)
\item Acknowledgements (optional)
\item Preface (optional)
\item Table of contents
\item List of tables
\item List of figures
\item List of drawings and enclosed material, e.g. CD (as appropriate)
\item Body Text
\item References
\item Appendices (as appropriate)
\end{itemize}

The front cover, front page, title page and back cover have a specific form as shown in the attached examples and shall contain all information requested.
No variation from this form is permitted.
If the thesis is written in English, the title on the title page shall be in English; however, an Icelandic translation of the title must be presented with an Icelandic abstract, and vice versa if the thesis is written in Icelandic.

An abstract is mandatory in English or Icelandic, following the language of the main text.
The maximum length of abstract is 300 words.
At the end of the abstract there should be a list of up to five keywords reflecting the content of the thesis.

The printed version of the thesis shall be on white paper of size B5 and weight \SI{80}{\gram\per\square\meter}.
The cover pages will be provided by the School. In general, the font should be STIX2 in 10 points.
Guidelines for page numbering and layout:

\begin{itemize}
\item Page numbering is normally i, ii, iii, iv, ... for material preceding the first chapter of the thesis (i.e. for abstract, signature page, acknowledgements, preface, table of contents etc.) and then
1, 2, 3, starting from the 1st chapter (Introduction) and continuing throughout the thesis, including the appendices.
\item Page numbers should in general be centered at the bottom of each page.
\end{itemize}
Only in exceptional cases may the thesis have a different form.
While the thesis itself has to comply with the layout instructions in regards to the cover pages, abstract and the signature page, it can consist mainly of publishable research paper manuscripts.
In this case, the manuscript(s) shall be preceded by a detailed section of introduction to the research topic with a corresponding in-depth literature review and detailed description of the methods used in the MSc project.
The minimum length of this section shall be 20 pages excluding a reference list.
This format of the MSc thesis should only be used if the supervisor of the thesis assesses the outcome of the MSc project to be publishable in indexed peer reviewed journals in the relevant field of research.
If this format of the MSc thesis is used, the student's supervisor has to request a formal acceptance of both the student's Department Head and the Director of Graduate Studies, with a letter summarizing the findings of the project, the novelty beyond the state of the art and the contribution of all authors of the manuscript.
This request has to be sent to the Department Head and the Director of Graduate Studies prior to $t-50$ (where “$t$” is the graduation date).
The Department Head and Director of Graduate Studies can forward the request to the Graduate Study Council for further evaluation if they find it necessary.

\subsection{Limited Access}
In general, access to the MSc thesis shall be open.
If restricting access to a thesis is sought, e.g.\ for the purpose of protecting intellectual property or protecting commercial interests of an industrial partner participating in the MSc project, permission needs to be acquired, see {\em Reglur um skil á lokaritgerðum og lokaverkefnum við Háskólann í Reykjavík\/} (\url{http://www.ru.is/bokasafn/skemman}).
If restriction of access to a thesis is granted it should be clearly stated in the thesis right after the keywords following the abstract with specification of the date at which the restriction of access should be lifted.

\subsection{Submission and Deadlines}
The official completion of the MSc thesis is signified by the student submitting the final electronic (PDF) version of the thesis, signed by himself/herself, the supervisor(s) and the examiner to the SSE office and uploaded to Skemman, (see \url{https://www.skemman.is}).
See also RU´s rules for submission of theses and final projects ({\em Reglur um skil á lokaritgerðum og lokaverkefnum við Háskólann í Reykjavík\/}, \url{http://www.ru.is/bokasafn/skemman}).

If a student plans to graduate in a particular graduation ceremony, the following deadlines must be respected.
Should any of the deadlines below not be respected the student will have to wait for the following graduation ceremony before he/she can graduate.
Students are responsible for adhering to these deadlines and are advised to deliver their work in good time.
The deadline schedule for the purpose of graduation is as follows (where $t$ is the graduation date and the
numbers refer to the number of days prior to graduation) as shown on Table~\ref{tab:deadlines}.
\begin{table}

\end{tablenotes}
\caption{Schedule for thesis according to expected graduation date.}\label{tab:deadlines}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

\subsection{Thesis Defense (Oral Examination Procedure)}
The examiner is selected by the Department Head in consultation with the supervisor(s).  
The choice of examiner needs to be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies.  
The examiner shall have the qualifications necessary to supervise the thesis, but must not have collaborated in the project on which the thesis is based and must fulfil the rules of Reykjavík University on impartiality of examiners.
The oral examination shall be open to the public and shall be announced through appropriate channels with at least 3 days notice.  
The examination should take the form of an approximately 30 minute presentation by the student, followed by questions from the examiner, School representative (most often the Department Head), supervisor(s) and the audience.  
The audience then leaves the room and the examiner(s), supervisor and School representative have the opportunity to put further questions to the candidate and, as appropriate, request modifications to the thesis.  
Subsequently, the candidate leaves the room and the examiner, School representative and supervisor(s) deliberate and decide upon the grade.  
Normally, the student will be informed of the grade the next day.  
If the thesis is subject to confidentiality, or for other valid reasons approved by the Director of Graduate Studies, the oral examination may be closed to the public.
\subsection{Grading}
The appointed examiner shall evaluate the thesis and the oral defense of the thesis, together with the
supervisor(s) and the department´s representative.  
One grade shall be awarded for the thesis and defence.  
The minimum passing grade is 6.0, see Guidelines for grading MSc theses in the appendix.  
The following factors shall be taken into account:

\begin{itemize}
\item Significance and originality of work
\item Scientific and technological challenge and results
\item Methodological quality
\item Presentation
\end{itemize}

The number of ECTS credits awarded for the Master’s project shall be taken into account.  
Thus, significantly more demands in terms of originality, quantity and scientific quality of the work should be placed on the student for a 60 ECTS thesis than a 30 ECTS thesis.
