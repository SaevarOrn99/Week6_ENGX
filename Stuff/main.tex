\begin{abstract}
    Our project is an semi-autonomous following wheelchair for wheelchair users that are not bound to the chair and want to enhance their ability to walk to reduce the use of the wheelchair.

  %The goal of this template is to produce electronic output to be uploaded to Skemman that can be later printed out and bound into a professional looking textbook that fits on standard library shelves.
  %It is important to note that A4 paper when bound requires taller shelf spacing, so the B5 paper format was chosen instead.
  %When binding a book, the edges that face outward need to be very smooth to reduce contamination and dust from entering the book when it sits on a shelf; this is why traditionally a larger paper size is cut down to the book size.
  %If your print house expects the stock to be A4, then make sure the rubook has the ``a4paper'' option.
  %If they prefer to deal with preparation themselves from a B5 pdf, then the default ``b5paper'' option is correct.
  %The template is optimized for lualatex, but should still work with pdflatex.
  
  %The abstract goes here in English or Icelandic.
  %It should be a fairly short summary of the entire document.
  %If you switch to Icelandic mode (IS option to ruthesis) then abstract will become \'{U}tdr\'{a}ttur

  %Keywords / Efnisord:  Keywords, separated, by, commas
